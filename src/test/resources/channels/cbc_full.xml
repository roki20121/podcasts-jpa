            <title>S9E03 - Putting Fans In Stands: How Sports Teams Sell Tickets</title>
            <description>This week, we look at the fascinating ways sports teams market themselves. We’ll unpack why one
                stadium replaced its ushers with librarians, why another encouraged fans to wear “awful" clothes and how
                a grammatical error put Toronto on the map. It all comes down to a strategic game plan.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s our annual look at brands I admire. They may not be
                the hippest, the latest or the coolest, but I envy them for a reason. Like the most iconic studio in
                rock history, the first casual shoe ever invented or the world’s most timeless sunglasses. Join us for a
                peek at a few of my favourite things…

            <title>S7E15 (Archive) - Hey Vern! When Ads Go Hollywood</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at commercials that made the unlikely leap to
                Hollywood. Some became big hit movies, others inspired popular songs. One even became a TV series that
                was voted one of the worst sitcoms of all time. But that’s what can happen when an ad hitchhikes to La
                La Land.

                brands were built on the backs of jingles. From the Big Mac, to Smarties, to Wheaties cereal, successful
                jingles stay lodged in our minds forever. Once you hear them, learn the melody and start singing the
                lyrics, you become the advertiser.

            <title>S9E02 - Goliath Meet David: Small Brands That Beat The Big Boys</title>
            <description>This week, we analyze how small brands outsmart their giant counterparts. We’ll look at a snack
                food company with a cult-like following that outsells Frito-Lay in Baltimore. A tiny soda brand that
                obliterates Coca Cola in Scotland. And a bubble gum-flavoured drink that beats all the giants only in
                Peru. Goliath, meet David.

            <description>Welcome to the 2020 Under the Influence season. It's good to be back. To kick things off, we
                step into the highly competitive world of Television Marketing. Between Netflix, Amazon, Crave and more,
                the marketing of TV shows has become a rat-race. And in a world where we can watch anything anytime,
                luring viewers back each week calls for some serious outside the box marketing.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore famous Products Named After Their Inventors.
                Some products are so cemented in our minds we forget their names once belonged to people. Shrapnel was
                invented by Henry Shrapnel, nachos were invented by Nachos Anaya and the leotard was invented by a Jules
                Leotard.
                We’ll even look at some inventors who wish their names had been forgotten...

                Some products are so cemented in our minds we forget their names once belonged to people. Shrapnel was
                invented by Henry Shrapnel, nachos were invented by Nachos Anaya and the leotard was invented by a Jules
                Leotard.

            <title>S7E10 (Archive) - Worthless To Priceless</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at products that went from Worthless to Priceless.
                Products someone created out of something everyone else ignored. It might be junk on the ground that
                people stepped over, or useless waste destined for the scrap heap. But in each case, the resulting
                product was a masterpiece of instinct and insight.

                by changing…their names. Many foods you enjoy started out life with very unappetizing names. Some so

                clients who hated the idea, focus groups that gave the thumbs-down, apprehension within the agency or
                even that the initial research declared them failures. But they survived and thrived because someone

            <itunes:summary>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the advertising campaigns that had
                everything stacked against them and yet went on to become hugely successful. The resistance may have
                come from clients who hated the idea, focus groups that gave the thumbs-down, apprehension within the
                agency or even that the initial research declared them failures. But they survived and thrived because
                someone said...Damn The Torpedoes.

            <title>S7E02 (Archive) - I See A Little Silhouetto Of A Brand: How Old School Products Survive</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we analyze how old school products survive in the 21st
                century. Many brands can’t keep up with the digital age, but others have found a way to succeed – some
                doing even better business today. We’ll look at how one company makes money by retiring its products,
                why another partnered up with its biggest competitors to stay relevant and how an entire profession
                saved itself by not going digital. From Crayola to Velveeta, it all comes down to smart marketing.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Kicking off season 7, we explore how some of the craziest fads are
                marketed. We'll look at how one student's school project changed the way we sleep, why a single toy made
                Tyco the subject of bomb threats and how a popular piece of jewellery was inspired...by doctors. From
                the Thighmaster to the Pet Rock, we'll break down what makes fads so absolutely irresistible.

                the marketing and advertising questions you've sent us through social media. From how we come up with
                new episode topics each week to why mattress companies don’t use sex to sell mattresses to which
                commercials are my all-time favourites - this year’s questions are fun and insightful.

            <title>S6E25 (Archive) - Bookmarks 2017</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s our annual Bookmarks episode. The research team at
                Under the Influence does a lot of reading over the year and finds a lot of great stories - many of which
                don't fit into our regular season. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't be told. We’ll look at why Sting
                laughs at the beginning of Roxanne, how the U.S. military learned a lesson in branding when it got
                soldiers to eat their vegetables and the interesting story behind which car was the first ever to
                feature…a cup holder.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore how some of society's biggest taboos were
                broken by marketers. We’ll look at why toilet paper was a hush-hush product in the 19th century, which
                publication was the first ever to print an ad on its front page and how Lysol was originally
                advertised…as contraception. Some taboos were broken years ago, some more recently than you may realize.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we analyze how marketing affects the sports world. We’ll
                look at the massive influence that comes with owning the rights to the Olympic games, how the recent

            <title>S6E19 (Archive) - Brand Envy: #CANADA150</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s our annual episode where we explore brands I admire.
                And in celebration of Canada’s 150th birthday in 2017, this year’s brands are all Canadian. We’ll look
                at what may be the most successful global retailer Canada’s ever built, a television pioneer worshipped
                and revered by generations of Canadians and a world-class brand that operates out of the smallest
                village in New Brunswick. We’ve certainly bred some amazing brands up here in the Great White North.
                Happy birthday, Canada.

            <title>S6E16 (Archive) - Guys and Dolls: Gender Marketing, Part II</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s part two of our Gender Marketing show. In this
                episode, we’ll look at how companies that have historically marketed to one gender switch gears to
                target another. We’ll analyze how Harley Davidson got women on two wheels, why a 13-year-old girl
                convinced Hasbro to make an Easy Bake Oven for boys and how Barbie targeted…dads. By and large, most
                products are gender-neutral. It's the marketing that's not.

                How did it all start? Why are aisles and products separated by gender? Why do some companies charge
                women more than men for identical items? Marketing different products to different genders leads to
                profit but also to big consequences. It’s not a black-and-white issue, but it’s definitely pink and

            <title>S5E18 (Archive) - Grab Your Wallet: When Brands Go Political</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore how brands are becoming political for the first
                time in history. We’ll look at what happens when major retailers decide to “Dump Trump,” the
                controversial Super Bowl ad that challenged an immigration policy and crashed the Internet and how even
                Pepsi could drop the political ball. Years ago, most advertisers would have never dreamed of offending
                anyone with a pulse and a wallet. But all that is changing.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the fine art of selling the dream. The world of
                Real Estate Marketing has its own rules, its own techniques and its own unique breed of salespeople.
                We'll tell the story of how the word "Realtor" was reluctantly blessed by Merriam-Webster, why so many
                real estate agents use photos of themselves as a marketing tactic and what happens when the real estate
                business tries enticing buyers using...humour. It's a form of marketing that touches all of us and it
                usually involves the biggest purchase of our lives.

            <title>S6E13 (Archive) - The Wizarding World of Influencer Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we peek into the emerging world of Influencer Marketing.
                Today, the most popular social media influencers aren't celebrities, they're regular people. Bloggers,
                Instagrammers, YouTube stars and Snapchatters have amassed millions of followers, promoting products
                using only the trust of their fans as currency. We'll look at a single YouTube review that shot Patti
                Labelle to the top of the baking industry, why J.K. Rowling only needed seven people to promote the
                biggest movie attraction of the year and exactly what happens when influencers break the trust of their
                loyal followers. It all comes down to integrity and transparency.

            <title>S6E11 (Archive) - The Frankenstein Factor: Inventors Who Regret Their Inventions</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we analyze inventors who later came to regret their
                inventions. Sometimes it's because the product ended up being harmful. Other times it's because of the
                way their product was used. But in most cases, the creators simply lost control of their creations.
                We'll look at why the inventor of the K-Cup doesn't own a Keurig machine, why the creator of Mother's
                Day later tried to have it rescinded and how the Wright Brothers lost control of the airplane. It's one
                of the most unwieldy aspects of marketing - you create a product, you inform the public, you put it into
                the marketplace, and it's out of your hands.

            <title>S6E10 (Archive) - The Odd Couple: Unlikely Marketing Collaborations</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we look at what happens when seemingly unrelated
                companies decide to partner up. By pooling their resources and, more importantly, by leveraging each
                other's strengths, unlikely brands collaborate to achieve much more than they could have achieved alone.
                We'll look at a hotel that partnered with an animal rescue organization by bringing dogs into the hotel,
                a budget-priced car that redefined the term "luxury vehicle" by teaming up with Prada and how NASA got
                the public to support the space industry using...a toy. Sometimes, odd couples click. And what they
                create together is highly unusual and unique.

            <title>S6E09 (Archive) - The Elephant In The Room: Humane Marketing vs. Profit</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we explore the controversial topic of Humane
                Marketing. From circuses to SeaWorld to fashion runways to fast food restaurants, each industry is
                dealing with mounting issues when it comes to the ethical treatment of animals, and their marketing is
                being affected as a result. This week, we'll look at how Ringling Brothers started using humane
                storytelling to draw customers, how Armani tipped the scales in the burgeoning "vegan clothing" world
                and the 2016 movie that may change the way animals are used in film forever. In this day and age, you
                can't ignore the elephant in the room.

            <title>S6E08 (Archive) - Brands In Cars Getting Coffee: Sponsorship Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we enter the delicate world of Sponsorship Marketing.
                Close to 20 billion sponsorship dollars are spent each year in North America. That money can keep a
                brand afloat, or it can cause a lot of tension. We'll look at how a single phone call from Coca Cola
                changed Christmas tradition forever, how Barbie helped save the Girl Scouts and what happens when a
                sponsor has to weather the demands...of the sponsee. The reason brands pick certain programs or events
                to sponsor is always strategic – and always interesting.

            <title>S6E06 (Archive) - Lead Balloons: When Negative Brand Names Work</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we analyze brand names that should never have worked.
                While most companies strive for positive names, others succeed with negative ones. Names that suggest
                the opposite of what the company is offering, or even risk offending the very customers it hopes to
                attract. We'll look at a band named after one of the biggest air disasters of the 20th century, a
                restaurant that proudly tries to clog its customers' arteries (and has on occasion) and a rental car
                company that promises junkers. It's a fine line between memorable and detrimental.

            <title>S6E05 (Archive) - Judgment Day: Super Bowl Advertising</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we take a look at the biggest day of the year for the
                advertising industry: The Super Bowl. The only sporting event where viewers pay as much attention to the
                commercials as they do the game. We'll analyze a tiny but ambitious brand that bet its entire marketing
                budget on one single Super Bowl commercial, a website that created a purposefully banned ad to generate
                free buzz and a company that created the most famous Super Bowl commercial of all time one year, then
                aired another the next that was such a flop, they sent the ad agency packing. That's why they call it
                "Judgment Day" - because careers and accounts hang in the balance on Super Bowl Sunday.

            <title>S6E04 (Archive) - What A Difference A Difference Makes: Standing Out In The Marketplace</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week we look at brands that separate themselves from the herd.
                In the world of marketing, standing out is the most critical thing a company can do. Having a distinct
                personality gives shoppers a reason to remember a brand and a reason to buy. We'll analyze a wrestler
                who used a delicate flower to intimidate his opponents, a single eye patch that gave one company a $28M
                bump in sales and a motorcycle brand that succeeded by taking the fun out of the ride.

            <title>S6E03 (Archive) - Passport Revoked: When Brands Fail Internationally</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we explore why some big brands fail when they
                attempt to expand internationally. It’s always interesting when massive companies with marketing
                firepower move into a new country and end up packing up their tents and going back home. Sometimes those
                companies succeed in other countries, but one just trips them up. We’ll look at how Home Depot and eBay
                originally struck out in China, why Germany didn’t take well to Walmart and we’ll dive deep into the
                real reasons Target failed in Canada. Amazing success stories at home, failures abroad.

            <title>S6E02 (Archive) - LIVE: Unforeseen Circumstances: How Companies Are Affected By Chance</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This episode was performed live at the Hot Docs Podfest in Toronto in
                front of 600 podcast lovers. In this show, we explore what happens to brands when a completely
                unexpected event occurs. Most companies tightly control every aspect of a brand - but occasionally, an
                unforeseen circumstance rears its head. And it’s always interesting to see how the company reacts and
                what happen to their business as a result. We’ll look at what happened to Ford Broncos after the OJ
                Simpson slow-speed car chase, what happened to Red Lobster after Beyonce gave it a sexy callout in a
                song, and what happened to James Bond when JFK gave the books a ringing endorsement. This episode
                includes a live Q&amp;A at the end with our team. So fun.

            <title>S6E01 (Archive) - The Crazy World of Trademarks</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: On this first episode of the 2017 season, we explore the crazy world
                of Trademarks. The key to success in marketing is to stand out from the crowd. One of the best ways to
                do that is with trademarks. Brands try to create logos or slogans or design features that they can
                protect legally, giving them unique marketing tools. In this episode, we'll look at a lawsuit between
                Disney and a music performer over a mouse trademark, we'll listen to how companies trademark sounds,
                we'll talk about a ring announcer who earned over $400 million from trademarking a single sentence and
                how shock rocker Marilyn Manson saved his career by trademarking his name.

            <title>S5E23 (Archive) - When Madison Avenue Met Broadway: The World of Industrial Musicals</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the little known and surprising world of
                Industrial Musicals. In an unexpected collision of Madison Avenue and Broadway, companies in the '50s
                began staging full-fledged musicals in an effort to inspire their employees, parade new product lines
                and boost morale. We'll look at one company that tripled the production costs of My Fair Lady to inspire
                its sales team, another that unknowingly funded one of the most iconic novels of our time and the
                handful of companies that still practice the art of Industrial Musicals today. Nothing inspires a
                marketing department quite like choreographed tap dancing.

            <title>S5E24 (Archive) - Commercial Parodies</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we take a peek into the risky, yet delicious world of
                commercial parodies. Some spoof ads are created just for the laughs, while others are sharp critiques of
                questionable products, overzealous advertising claims and self-congratulatory corporations. We'll look
                at a magazine that satirized one of the most controversial court cases of the century, a company that
                parodied the competition, then sued another company for parodying their parody, and unpack the Saturday
                Night Live skits that brought commercial parodies into the mainstream. Commercial parodies didn't just
                lampoon the ad industry, they influenced it.

            <itunes:subtitle>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we take a peek into the risky, yet delicious world of
                commercial parodies. Some spoof ads are created just for the laughs, while others are sharp critiques of
                questionable products, overzealous advertising claims and self-congratulatory corporations. We'll look
                at a magazine that satirized one of the most controversial court cases of the century, a company that
                parodied the competition, then sued another company for parodying their parody, and unpack the Saturday
                Night Live skits that brought commercial parodies into the mainstream. Commercial parodies didn't just
                lampoon the ad industry, they influenced it.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: The research team at Under The Influence does a lot of reading over
                the year and finds a lot of great stories - many of which don’t fit into our regular episodes. But that
                doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be told. This week, we’ll tell the story of how Stephen King’s wife Tabitha
                fished a story out of the wastepaper basket that changed their lives, how Engelbert Humperdinck’s
                manager tricked his record company into signing him, how Rocket Richard taught an enforcer a lesson and
                we’ll tell an emotional story about one of the most memorable scenes from M*A*S*H. Then, we’ll extract
                the marketing lessons from each of those incredible tales.

            <title>S5E21 (Archive) - Persuasive Perks: The World of Loyalty Programs</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the world of loyalty programs. In this day and
                age, marketers do everything possible to encourage loyal customers, and loyalty programs are one of the
                most effective ways to retain them. We’ll go back in time to see how the first loyalty programs started,
                and we’ll analyze the marketing strategies behind today’s programs to see how they really work. Loyalty
                cards may give shoppers points, miles and merchandise, but what they give marketers is fascinating.

            <title>S5E19 (Archive) - Strange Bedfellows: Advertising &amp; Porn, Part II</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s part two of our Strange Bedfellows episode. It’s not
                just smaller brands that are beginning to advertise on porn sites, Hollywood has come knocking, too.
                Large audiences and cheap ad rates are making advertisers ignore the risk in the hunt for reward. At the
                same time, porn sites are starting to advertise in mainstream media, and are trying to entice
                advertisers with analytics, public service messages and even college scholarships. It’s an interesting
                crossroad and a very dangerous intersection.

            <title>S5E18 (Archive) - Strange Bedfellows: Advertising &amp; Porn, Part I</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the increasingly blurred line between
                advertising and porn. There has always been a line advertisers wouldn’t cross to promote their wares -
                but now some marketers have tiptoed over that line to advertise on porn sites. From food companies to
                fashion brands to Hollywood movies, marketers have breached the final frontier in their search for
                bigger, more affordable audiences. And on the other side of the tracks, porn sites are beginning to
                advertise in mainstream media. It’s a big risk for these strange bedfellows.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This is our annual episode where Terry tells some interesting stories
                about the brands he admires. This year, it includes the very first toy ever advertised on television in
                1952, a teen magazine dedicated to heartthrobs, the only trailer people can name-check on highways and a
                book that can be found in every hotel room. Each of these brands has a special reason why it has
                survived and thrived.

            <title>S5E15 (Archive) - Business As Unusual: The World of B2B Advertising</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the world of business-to-business advertising.
                It used to be the most boring advertising in the world - where green copywriters cut their teeth and
                washed-up copywriters ended their careers. But all that changed when B2B companies dared advertise at
                the Super Bowl, and showed the marketing world that advertising industrial equipment could be as sexy as
                advertising a sports car.

            <title>S5E14 (Archive) - World's Oldest Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we search for some of the world’s oldest brands. 80% of
                companies fold after 18 months, the ones that survive average a 50 year lifespan, then there are the
                ones that manage to last 100, 300 or sometimes even 600 years. We’ll look at a retail store that began
                in 1670, a brewery that poured its first beer in 1366 and the oldest fast food joint that used root beer
                to attract drinkers during Prohibition. Join us as we look for the magical ingredient in companies that
                last centuries.

            <title>S5E13 (Archive) - Bouncing Back: How Marketers Survive Debacles</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at how marketing companies bounce back from
                blunders and epic missteps. Yes, most apologize, but what happens after the apology? We find out by
                telling the story of an airline that mistakenly offered business class tickets to Europe for $39, the
                cautionary tale of a company that made fun of a very serious Twitter hashtag and paid the price, the way
                a major candy bar company was forced to pull a global campaign off the air but came back even stronger
                and the odd story of how a mattress company offended almost everybody with an ad, then apologized, then
                took the apology back.

            <title>S5E11 (Archive) - Liar For Hire: And Other Strange Service Companies</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: While there are many strange products in the world, there are even
                stranger service companies. This week, we talk about a company that rents wedding guests, a company you
                can hire to actually cuddle you and a company that promises to cure your hangover in just a few hours.
                And if you need an alibi to go with that hangover, there’s a company that markets lies, too.

            <title>S5E10 (Archive) - Live and Let Buy: Where You Live Dictates What You Purchase</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: The most interesting cultural differences aren’t country to country,
                they're province to province, state to state and even city to city. This week, we explore how and why
                people living in different locations buy such vastly different products. British Columbia likes to show
                off luxury cars, Toronto likes big homes, and New York likes luxury watches. The most pampered pets live
                in Saskatchewan. Last year, the city that bought the most sex paraphernalia was Victoria, this year it’s
                a city out east. Join us to find out which one. Live &amp; Let Buy: where you live dictates what you
                buy.

            <title>S5E09 (Archive) - Achilles Heel Advertising: Repositioning The Competition</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore when a smaller advertiser attacks the weak spot
                in a bigger advertiser’s marketing. It’s a strategy of brinksmanship, because it means a smaller company
                not only chooses to attack a larger company, but it attacks the weakness in a bigger company’s strength.
                It takes surgical precision, but when done well, the smaller advertiser gains market share, while
                diminishing the bigger company’s reputation at the same time. We’ll talk about how Avis aimed an arrow
                at Hertz, how Tylenol overtook the much larger Bayer Aspirin, how Scope used a slingshot to battle the
                Goliath in the mouthwash category, and the amusing story of how a potato chip company battled a
                competitor by finding the soft spot in its ingredient list.
                This is an encore episode that aired originally on March 3, 2016.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we explore the marketing of Movie Merchandise. From
                the earliest days of merchandising book characters to the true beginning of movie merchandising with the
                birth of Mickey Mouse and the Disney Studio, the marketing of toys and games became a critical strategy
                for movie and television studios. We chart the milestones in entertainment merchandising, how those
                milestones became a marketing strategy to build loyal audiences and how the biggest merchandising
                breakthrough in a galaxy far, far away changed everything.

            <itunes:summary>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we explore the marketing of Movie Merchandise.
                From the earliest days of merchandising book characters to the true beginning of movie merchandising
                with the birth of Mickey Mouse and the Disney Studio, the marketing of toys and games became a critical
                strategy for movie and television studios. We chart the milestones in entertainment merchandising, how
                those milestones became a marketing strategy to build loyal audiences and how the biggest merchandising
                breakthrough in a galaxy far, far away changed everything.

            <title>S5E06 (Archive) - Words Invented By Marketers</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore Words Invented By Marketers. Many of those
                words found their way into the dictionary and have become part of our daily language, like
                “Dependability” and “Halitosis.” While some other familiar words like Retsyn and Fahrvergnugen were
                around for a short time, then disappeared into the annals of commercial history. We’ll also get to the
                bottom of Corinthian Leather.

            <title>S5E05 (Archive) - Small Move, Big Gain</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This episode explores how small moves can result in huge business
                gains. While much of the business world spends its time looking for the big idea, many companies enjoy
                massive results with tiny moves and subtle tweaks. We’ll look at how a hit movie that was turned down by
                every studio in town was finally sold thanks to a small change in the way it was pitched, how Obama used
                a small tactic to beat John McCain and how broccoli made a small move to become popular during the
                infamous OJ Simpson trial.

            <title>S5E04 (Archive) - When Marketers Lie</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the consequences when marketing companies lie.
                From the Volkswagen scandal, to a promotion that brought Hoover to its knees, to a company that promised
                super-charged sexual enhancement, each was a case of fraud with disastrous repercussions. Join us as we
                explore what happened and whether those companies ever regained the trust of their customers.
                This is an encore episode that aired originally on January 27, 2016.

            <title>S5E03 (Archive) - Zombie Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, the topic is Zombie Brands - products and companies that
                had a long run of success, then ran into difficulties, and were either shut down or slipped into
                bankruptcy - only to rise from the dead and exist yet again. We’ll look at an airline grounded 25 years
                ago that has taken flight again, a retailer that died and came back, a television show that was
                cancelled then resurrected to become one of the most successful of all time and an automobile that once
                ruled the road, was then discontinued, then exhumed. All zombie brands that still roam the earth.

            <title>S5E02 (Archive) - Promise Less, Profit More</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Most products offer customers as many features and benefits as
                possible in order to lure shoppers toward a purchase. But then there are some companies that offer you
                less and profit more. We’ll look at a book company that eliminated their books and made millions, an
                electronics company that broke all the rules by eliminating the recording function from a tape machine
                and made history and how two companies looked at a shoe and made millions by throwing away the laces.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In our first episode of the 2016 season, we look at how the marketing
                industry created many of our everyday rituals. We don't think twice about having bacon &amp; eggs for
                breakfast, or taking a coffee break, or using soap to wash our hands. But each of those routine rituals
                was invented by marketing companies to sell more product. You may even be surprised to learn that when
                our kids trick or treat has a marketing story behind it. Join us as we explore how these and many more
                rituals began and how they influence your life.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This is the final episode of our 10th season on CBC. And to
                celebrate, we turn the show over to you. That means Terry will be answering listener questions. He’ll
                talk about why he chose advertising as a profession, how political marketing differs from product
                marketing, whether the jingle is definitely dead, why some bad commercials actually work and how he
                would advertise marijuana brands. The questions are fun, insightful and amusing. Hope you’ll tune in.

                celebrate, we turn the show over to you. That means Terry will be answering listener questions. He’ll
                talk about why he chose advertising as a profession, how political marketing differs from product
                marketing, whether the jingle is definitely dead, why some bad commercials actually work and how he
                would advertise marijuana brands. The questions are fun, insightful and amusing. Hope you’ll tune in.

                turning this show over to you, our listeners, and answering your questions on the air. From whether
                subliminal advertising exists, to if my career has made me a cynical consumer, to which of the Beatles
                was the best marketer, this year’s questions were fun and insightful. Oh - and you’ll get a chance to
                meet the team, too.

            <title>S4E22 (Archive) - The Internet of (Marketing) Things</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the impact of the Internet of Things on the
                world of marketing. Soon, most of the devices in our lives will be given a digital voice. Your fridge
                will be doing your weekly grocery shopping for you - and that means marketers will have to send discount
                coupons to your appliances. Your car will be able to make appointments with a mechanic all by itself,
                and you can now order laundry detergent, coffee and bathroom tissue with the push of Wi-Fi Amazon Dash
                button in your home. We’ll look at the fine line between convenience and intrusion and why marketers are
                looking forward the Internet of (marketing) Things.

                The Influence research books that didn’t make our regular season. We’ll tell the story of why Tim
                Hortons always chooses brown bricks for their stores, how Best Buy helped men set up their electronics
                without offending their manhood, an amusing story about the problem of Ronald McDonald taking naps
                between scenes of a television commercial and how Levis sold a product to the teenagers of Europe that
                they didn’t even want - but eventually loved.

                are so high in the world of marketing, it leads to some interesting - and odd - lawsuits. We’ll tell the
                story of how an elderly woman sued McDonald’s because her coffee spilled on her lap and why she won the
                case. How Microsoft came gunning for a 17 year-old Mike Rowe's website with the domain name
                www.MikeRoweSoft.com. How a Hollywood actress sued a store for tweeting a photo of her shopping there.
                And the amusing story of Hall &amp; Oates suing a company over a cereal called Haulin’ Oats. Everyone
                rise, court is in session.

            <title>S8E24 - God Save The Commercial: When Ads Are Banned</title>
            <description>This week, we look at Banned Commercials. The majority of the time, ads are banned for being
                sexist or too suggestive. But many commercials are banned for other, more fascinating reasons. Sometimes
                bans cripple a campaign, other times they’re puzzling, but more often than not, they’re rocket fuel.

                design can be bad even when it's good.

            <title>S4E17 (Archive) - Show Me The Money: The World of Product Placement</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore the world of Product Placement. From the first
                product placement in a movie in 1927, to E.T., to the latest movies and TV shows, advertisers look for
                opportunities to give their products starring roles. We’ll look at the history of product placement, how
                it evolved and the most famous examples of how it went right - and how it went horribly wrong.

            <title>S4E16 (Archive) - Brand Envy 2015</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it’s Terry's annual look at his favourite brands. They may
                not be the coolest brands, or the newest or the biggest - they are just fascinating studies in
                marketing. Terry looks at an armoured truck company that decided to transport money instead of packages,
                a business that started because of spilled milk, a board game created to protest capitalism and a
                51-year-old game show that still attracts over 25 million viewers per week. Each wildly successful, each
                still going today and each one of them survived because of an unforeseen opportunity.

            <title>S4E15 (Archive) - Tourism Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the world of Tourism Marketing. Every country
                and city competes for lucrative tourism dollars, and the resulting marketing is often highly creative
                and fascinating. We’ll tell the story of a city that promised to keep secrets, a state that offered one
                tourist the job of a lifetime, and a country that actually benefited from being insulted in a movie.

            <description>This week, we unpack the nuanced world of Advertising Disclaimers. We'll look at the most
                absurd product disclaimers of all time, why a shocking disclaimer on a brand of Lays chips sparked a 50%
                drop in sales and the presidential attack ads that changed political disclaimers forever. It really puts
                the "risk" in asterisk. Hope you'll join us.

            <title>S4E14 (Archive) - Limited Edition Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore Limited Edition Brands. Many marketers often
                release special-edition products of their mainstream brands. It may be a special limited-time flavour or
                colour, or it may be a kooky version of their usual product. It's an interesting marketing strategy,
                because marketers create limited-edition brands for very specific reasons - to generate new attention,
                or test-drive a new product or to celebrate an event. Some work, some don't - but the stories behind
                them are often fascinating.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at one of the newest trends in marketing called
                Giftvertising. Where marketers surprise their customers with elaborate free gifts, film their reactions

                stores, big brands are embracing the trend. We'll also look at the psychology behind Giftvertising, why
                it works, and the pros and cons of employing it.

                mindset of the Millennial generation. A demographic bigger than the Baby Boomers, Millennials have been
                conditioned by the Great Recession to shed the responsibility of ownership. They want the movie, but not
                the DVD. They want the music, but not the CD. They want the ride, but not the car. That attitude is
                beginning to have an enormous impact on marketers, as the biggest consumer demographic in history would
                rather share than buy. Join us as we explore the marketing implications of the sharing economy.

            <title>S8E22 - Bookmarks 2019</title>
            <description>This week, it's our annual Bookmarks episode - where we tell fascinating stories from our
                research that didn't make it into the regular season. Like - why Beatles producer George Martin was
                first assigned to the Fab Four as punishment by his boss. Why an episode of Mary Tyler Moore was
                considered to be so morbid that a brand new director had to be brought in to handle it tastefully. And
                why there were blank spaces in Bill Murray's original Caddyshack script. Hope you'll join us.

            <title>S4E09 (Archive) - Geography As Branding</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: The issue of geography is a subject the marketing world subscribes
                to. Many companies, and even entire industries, attach their brands to geographical points of origin as
                a way to differentiate themselves and assert superiority. From German engineering to Russian vodka to
                Swiss watches, "Geography as Branding" is a powerful marketing strategy that often comes with a premium
                price tag. This week, we explore if that premium price tag is justified...

            <title>S4E08 (Archive) - For Your Consideration: The Hollywood Oscar Campaigns The Public Never Sees</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: The wins and losses at the Academy Awards change the fortunes of
                actors, directors and films. But what the public never sees is how movie studios - and some actors -
                campaign to win those Oscars. The strategies used to influence Academy voters are fascinating, involving
                millions of dollars, trade advertising, parties, swag, the White House, law suits and even trips to old
                age homes to sway elderly voters. Grab a bag of popcorn and tune in.

            <title>S4E06 (Archive) - Marketing Hit Songs</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at how hit songs are marketed. With music sales in
                decline, recording artists are turning to inventive marketing ideas to sell their albums. From the first
                24-hour music video, to hiding lyrics in library books, to downloading a new album onto 500 million
                music libraries, to the opposite strategy of issuing one single copy of a new album, marketing hit songs
                has never had more interesting notes.

            <title>S4E01 (Archive) - Strange Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we looks at some of the strangest brands that exist in the
                world. Some are the result of odd licensing deals - like WikiLeaks, which is now licensing its brand out
                to other manufacturers. Others are the result of unusual marketing opportunities - like a Burger King
                body spray. We kid you not. From Mandela wines to Motörhead Shiraz, we explore how these strange
                products came about, the thinking behind them, and the resulting sales results. Hey, even the U.S.
                Marines have their own cologne.

            <description>This week, it's our annual look at brands I admire. They may not be the coolest or the biggest
                brands - but they're fascinating studies in marketing. From a record store with a sense of humour to a
                cartoon with virtually no dialogue, this year's list gives me a mean case of Brand Envy.

            <title>S8E20 - To Bleep Or Not To Bleep: Vulgar Trademarks</title>
            <description>This week, we look at the use of profanity in marketing and the resulting upsurge in Vulgar
                Trademarks. Four-letter words aren't just sought out by small, feisty companies looking for attention
                anymore, but by some of the largest advertisers in the world. Is it obscene, or is it free speech? These
                days, I swear it's hard to tell.

            <title>S4E03 (Archive) - Selling Ugly</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Not all products are beautiful. While it's easy to sell a gorgeous
                item, the degree of difficulty ratchets up when the item is butt-ugly. Some ugly products need a lot of
                clever marketing to succeed, while no amount of marketing can save other hideous brands. Then, every
                once in a while, some ugly products become runaway hits. In this episode, we tell the story of how a big
                grocery store figured out a way to sell deformed vegetables, how ugly footwear continues to attract
                millions of customers, how ugly toys created an empire and how the car industry has had mixed success
                selling some of the ugliest cars in history. No doubt about it, ugly can be pretty fascinating.

            <title>S4E02 (Archive) - Controversy Advertising</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we tackle the topic of Controversy Advertising. The number
                one job of all advertising is to get attention, and many brands choose to use controversial advertising
                ideas to break through the clutter. It's a risky strategy, as controversy always courts trouble. We look
                at how Kmart used controversy to blow the dust off its staid image, how Kimberly-Clark used an
                eyebrow-raising idea to sell a discrete product and we tell the story of how one advertiser tried to sue
                his advertising agency for generating the wrong kind of controversy during the Super Bowl.

            <title>S4E05 (Archive) - Selling The Moon, Part II</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In Part Two of "Selling The Moon," we pick up the story with the
                success of the Gemini program, which leads NASA to believe they might reach the moon faster than
                anticipated. But then tragedy strikes and the Apollo project is put on hold for more than a year. But
                when the improved Apollo program returns, the race to the moon accelerates - as does the remarkable
                marketing that surrounds it. NASA continues to sell the moon landing as a technological marvel that will
                benefit Americans, advertisers jump on the bandwagon, television networks brace for the big landing, and
                Neil Armstrong finally delivers on JFK's promise.

            <title>S4E04 (Archive) - Selling The Moon, Part I</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we present Part One of our "Selling The Moon" episode.
                Across two episodes, we'll trace the way NASA marketed the expensive moon landing to both the American
                public, and to Congress. In this first part, we see how the Russians got to space first, prompting
                President John F. Kennedy to promise a moon landing - not only as a way to win the space race - but to
                improve his public relations after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. The journey to the moon will be one of the
                most expensive endeavours in history, and NASA needed to constantly market the program to keep Americans
                interested, and Congress signing the cheques. Part One is all about putting the moon shot in motion. In
                Part Two, we'll pick up the story with the Apollo program, the tragedies and achievements that push the
                space program closer to the moon, and the way NASA never took its foot off the marketing/PR pedal until
                Armstrong climbed down that historic ladder.

            <title>S8E19 - Selling The Dream: Real Estate Advertising (An Encore Presentation)</title>
            <description>This week - in an encore broadcast - we look at the fine art of selling the dream. The world of
                Real Estate Marketing has its own rules, its own techniques and its own unique breed of salespeople.
                We'll tell the story of how the word "Realtor" was reluctantly blessed by Merriam-Webster, why so many
                real estate agents use photos of themselves as a marketing tactic and what happens when the real estate
                business tries enticing buyers using humour. It's a form of marketing that touches all of us and it
                usually involves the biggest purchase of our lives.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Well, this is the final episode of the 2014 season. As as we do every
                year, we turn this show over to our listeners. I'll answer all the marketing and advertising questions
                listeners have sent in, and this year, the questions are better than ever. We'll trace the history of
                how Kool-Aid/Lemonade stands came to be, discuss why #1 brands still feel compelled to advertise,
                explore why Cadillac owners don't like vanilla ice-cream, why advertisers love using babies and small
                critters in their ads, what the rules are when it comes to the amount of advertising allowed every hour
                - and more. It's a fun Q&amp;A - hope you'll join us.

            <title>S8E18 - Under The Influence of My Influences</title>
            <description>This week, I'll be sharing some of the major influences in my life that helped inform my
                thinking and shape my career. Including a snowplow ad from my childhood, the sound effects from one very
                specific cartoon, hilarious actors I worked with and seeing the corner of a billboard flapping in the
                wind. It's a little lesson in who's had me under the influence.

            <title>S3E20 (Archive) - Selling Death</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at how companies sell death. While death is
                usually a forbidden word in advertising, the subject of death is slowly becoming more mainstream. We'll
                look at the one industry that truly specializes in it - the funeral industry. From QR codes on
                headstones, to live cams on caskets, to fish reefs made from your ashes, funeral homes are starting to
                market brand new services to attract customers. We'll also look at the recent popularity of death as
                entertainment - with the record-breaking audiences for The Walking Dead and a certain reality show
                called "Best Funeral Ever."

            <title>S3E21 (Archive) - 21st Century Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at 21st Century Brands. Only 14 years into a new
                era, and it's astounding to look at all the new brands and categories that have changed our world.
                Companies that have market values greater than 100 year-old companies, six-year old gadgets that rule
                our lives, and brand new product categories that demand unprecedented marketing strategies - all of
                which creates a list of 20th century products that are quietly disappearing. It's eye-opening when you
                take stock.

            <title>S3E23 (Archive) - Satisfaction Guaranteed</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we search for companies that offer 100%, no
                questions-asked, no fine print lifetime guarantees. They're hard to find, as not many companies are
                willing to offer that unlimited return policy. We'll look at one of the companies that pioneered the
                100% lifetime guarantee, a company that abandoned 100% lifetimes guarantees after 75 years and we'll
                talk about the extreme risks these kind of guarantees pose, and the even greater rewards these companies
                enjoy.

            <title>S3E24 (Archive) - When Brands Mock Other Brands</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at brands that mock other brands. It's a risky
                strategy, as one company has to ridicule another brand to make a point - and mocking a rival always
                fuels retaliation. We'll talk about how Miller High Life mocked Anheuser-Busch during the Super Bowl,
                how Jaguar mocked Mercedes, how Samsung mocked Apple, how Apple mocked Samsung, and how Apple kind of
                perfected mocking when it set its sights on Microsoft.

            <description>This week, we look at celebrities with their very own brands. From a small town general store
                owned by a comedian to a cosmetics empire started by an 18-year-old to a winery that was funded by the
                Godfather movies - a few of them are even billion-dollar enterprises.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it's our annual book show. The research for Under The
                Influence requires a lot of reading, and listeners always ask for more information about the books we
                mention. So we take the opportunity every year to talk about the research books we've read, and tell
                additional stories from those books. In this year's show, we'll talk about how Bobby Orr met Gordie
                Howe's elbow, how the Romans turned their weakness in sea battles into a strength, how baggage
                inspectors at El-Al Airlines put their lives on the line, and how the rock band Kiss did something so
                wonderful for their fans that it ended up putting Kiss on the map.

            <title>S3E16 (Archive) - Brand Envy 2014</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it's Terry's annual episode where he features four brands
                he admires. It might be because the brand broke new ground, or has managed to stay #1, or just because
                it has been a part of our lives for so long. With that in mind, he'll celebrate a certain mac &amp;
                cheese that has been with us since 1937, a TV show that broke ground in 1969, a condiment that has been
                #1 for over 100 years and the most successful movie franchise of all time.
                This is an archived episode that aired originally on April 19, 2014.

            <title>S3E17 (Archive) - Nudge: The Persuasive Power of Whispers</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the subtle art of "nudging." Schools, marketers
                and even governments are now using small nudges to gently steer people toward making more positive
                decisions in their lives. Those nudges included sending people a handwritten note when they are behind
                on their taxes because a handwritten note gets their attention, or putting the image of a housefly in
                urinals so men had something to aim at, thereby eliminating overspray by 80%. Or the simple act of
                getting high school kids to fill out a college application before they graduated that changed the course
                of their lives. Nudges are small, almost invisible and often controversial. It's a fascinating new
                aspect of influence.

            <title>S3E19 (Archive) - When Founders Are The Face of The Company</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we discuss what happens when founders are the face of a
                company. No one can relay the passion of a company like the founder - but while they may be the heart
                and soul of a company, should they be the face? We'll explore what happened to Kentucky Fried Chicken
                after the Colonel died, how Dave Thomas built Wendy's to be the #3 burger company, how Martha Stewart's
                company coped when their founder went to jail and the curious story of how Men's Wearhouse fired their
                own founder - after he had been the face of the company for over 30 years.

            <title>S8E16 - Red Sheep: The Power of Word-Of-Mouth Advertising</title>
            <description>This week, we explore Word-of-Mouth Advertising. Most businesses hope good products and
                excellent service are enough to encourage positive recommendations. But the smartest companies actually
                have strategies to ignite word-of-mouth chatter. It's the oldest form of advertising, but it's the most
                effective by far.

            <title>S3E10 (Archive) - Viral Videos</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we look at the wild and crazy world of Viral Videos.
                Some brands spend big money on videos and nobody watches, meanwhile a cat video is viewed by millions.
                It's a world with no rules, fuelled by luck and timing. We'll look at the most-viewed videos ever,
                including a video a woman made when she quit her job that attracted almost 10 million views, the Evian
                bottled water video that went into the Guinness Book of World Records and a Dove video that broke the
                Evian world record. These days, marketers can't necessarily spend their way to consumer attention, they
                have to earn it. And Viral Videos can be just the ticket.

                himself - they all spent their formative years writing copy. Each learned some valuable skills on their
                way to the top. And their stories are remarkable.

            <title>S3E12 (Archive) - Sunny With a Chance of Mousetraps: How Weather Affects Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore How Weather Affects Marketing. With 75 years of
                climate data cross-referenced with reams of shopping research, marketers can now use the weather to
                predict sales. Sears Automotive knows that 5-year old car batteries die after three consecutive days of
                sub-zero temperatures, so they advertise on day four. The busiest day of the week at Harley-Davidson
                dealerships is exactly 22°C and sunny. When spring temperatures hit 21°C, hair removal products surge
                1400%, and BBQ sales jump 200%. And did you know that when the temperature drops just one degree in the
                Fall - just one degree - mousetrap sales surge 25%? Marketers do. And while they can't manage weather,
                marketers can certainly now manage the financial implications of weather. It's a whole new day.

                consecutive days of sub-zero temperatures, so they advertise on day four. The busiest day of the week at
                Harley-Davidson dealerships is exactly 22°C and sunny. When spring temperatures hit 21°C, hair removal
                products surge 1400%, and BBQ sales jump 200%. And did you know that when the temperature drops just one
                degree in the Fall - just one degree - mousetrap sales surge 25%? Marketers do. And while they can't
                manage weather, marketers can certainly now manage the financial implications of weather. It's a whole
                new day.

            <title>S3E14 (Archive) - Elevator Pitches</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at Elevator Pitches. The marketing industry is a
                business of short, concise messages. Be it the confines of 30 seconds, the space in a print ad or the
                restrictions of Twitter. The true test of an idea is whether or not it can be explained in just a few
                words. An elevator pitch forces that discipline - if an idea can be explained in the time it takes an
                elevator to go from the first floor to the second floor, it's probably a solid idea. And if it can't be
                - it probably means the advertising idea is fuzzy. We'll explore the art of the elevator pitch in
                business, in publishing and in the land of the quick pitch - Hollywood.

            <title>S8E15 - Little Big Towns: Roadside Attractions As Marketing</title>
            <description>This week, we explore roadside attractions as marketing. Interesting and often quirky landmarks
                that put small towns on the map. We'll look at one town that leveraged its name to bring in thousands of
                TV fans, one that built a giant animal statue to get highway drivers to take a detour and another that
                built a monument to attract both human and non-human visitors.

            <title>S3E07 (Archive) - Ambush Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at Ambush Marketing. It's a form of marketing
                where a brand tries to connect itself with an event like the FIFA World Cup - but WITHOUT paying
                sponsorship fees. It merely ambushes the festivities. Or one brand intrudes on another brand's
                advertising to gain attention. Either way, it's uninvited advertising, it's very controversial - plus
                the stories are riveting. And the Olympics has a long and fascinating history with ambush marketing.

                products, how they market those products, how consumers are drawn to companies that offer customization

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In our first episode of Season 3, we explore #1 Brands. We'll look at
                popular categories and identify the runaway best-selling brands and analyze why they are #1. The
                best-selling car in Canada has been on top for 15 years. Know what it is? Bet you can't guess the #1
                pharmaceutical drug in Canada - it's completely different from the top one in the U.S. Most re-tweeted
                Tweet of all time? Number one in-home coffee brand? Hint: It's not Tim Hortons. Some brands are on top
                because they solve our problems, some win through sheer media weight and others are reflections of our
                deepest desires.

            <title>S3E02 (Archive) - The Psychology of Price</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In this episode, we explore how we're all influenced by pricing. Like
                how the price of a bottle of wine has an enormous affect on how much you enjoy that wine. We'll analyze
                how restaurants design menus to steer you toward the most profitable dishes and how retail stores use
                psychology to persuade you to spend more. We'll also explore the psychological power of the number "9" -
                how we're drawn to prices that end in "99 cents." And how we're willing to pay more for products that
                end in the number 9! Pricing has a lot more to do with psychology than straight math. It's all about
                marketing and it's an eye-opening story.

                analyze how restaurants design menus to steer you toward the most profitable dishes and how retail
                stores use psychology to persuade you to spend more. We'll also explore the psychological power of the
                number "9" - how we're drawn to prices that end in "99 cents." And how we're willing to pay more for
                products that end in the number 9! Pricing has a lot more to do with psychology than straight math. It's
                all about marketing and it's an eye-opening story.

            <title>S3E03 (Archive) - Cause Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Unlike public service announcements or corporate philanthropy, Cause
                Marketing is when a Not-For-Profit organization teams up with a For-Profit company to further a good
                cause - but the For-Profit partner makes a profit while helping. It's a contentious strategy - as most
                people don't like to hear the word "profit" in the same breath as "charity." But this new marketing
                strategy depends on profit to survive. We'll tell the story of how Cause Marketing began in the 1980s,
                how Bono's RED organization learned a hard lesson about cause marketing and how several big corporations
                teamed up with worthy causes to make the world a better place. While making their balance sheets better
                at the same time.

            <title>S3E06 (Archive) - Marketing The Olympics</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the big-money world of Olympic advertising.
                From the very first Olympic sponsors in 1896, we'll track the ever increasing presence of advertising in
                the Games - from the marketing milestones to the resulting controversies - including the year the IOC
                approved Olympic cigarettes! We'll also analyze how the IOC deals with the tension between keeping the
                Olympic ideals in place while needing more and more advertising revenue every four years. It's a
                fascinating journey.
                This is an encore episode that aired originally on February 7, 2014.

            <title>S8E13 - Promise Less, Profit More (An Encore Presentation)</title>
            <description>This week, it's an encore broadcast of Promise Less, Profit More. Most products offer customers
                as many features and benefits as possible in order to lure shoppers toward a purchase. But then there
                are some companies that offer you less, and profit more. We'll look at a book company that eliminated
                their books and made millions, an electronics company that broke all the rules by eliminating the
                recording function from a tape machine and made history, and how two companies looked at a shoe and made
                millions by throwing away the laces.

            <title>S2E25 (Archive) - Dear Terry</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: It's our last episode of the season. And every year, we turn our
                annual season finale over to listeners and answer their questions about advertising. We'll discuss the
                finer details of fine print in TV commercials, the impact of DVRs on advertising, why politicians don't
                use jingles, why advertisers use teaser ads, why the same actors keep showing up in the same
                commercials, why it seems like lawyers write the copy in so many ads, and why some ads are just so dumb.
                It will be a buffet of Q&amp;A. Hope you'll join us for our last episode of Season Two.

            <title>S8E09 - Unwitting Endorsers</title>
            <description>This week, we explore the world of Unwitting Endorsers. Sometimes a celebrity is featured in an
                advertising campaign without his or her knowledge or permission. There's no denying the pull of
                celebrity, but a brand is a legal property. And if you trespass, you risk trouble.

            <title>S2E19 (Archive) - Nothing In Common: How Hollywood Portrays Ad People</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at how Hollywood has portrayed advertising over
                the years. Most pilots, lawyers and doctors roll their eyes at the way Hollywood depicts them - and ad
                people are no exception. From the 1947 movie The Hucksters, to the Rock Hudson/Doris Day film Love Come
                Back, to Darrin Stephens in Bewitched, to Dudley Moore in Crazy People, to the Tom Hanks movie Nothing
                In Common, all the way to Mad Men. We'll rate them all, and see where they got it right and where they
                got it very, very wrong. Join us for a fun and funny journey through the decades.

            <title>S2E20 (Archive) - Real Time Advertising</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at Real Time Advertising. For over 100 years, most
                ad campaigns took months to produce. Suddenly, with the emergence of the Internet and social media,
                advertisers can react in minutes. From answering questions live on YouTube to the immediate messages
                brands put out during the blackout at this year's Super Bowl to instant marketing during snowstorms and
                hurricanes, it demonstrates how far advertising has come. It's no longer a game of inches, it's a game
                of seconds.

            <title>S2E15 (Archive) - Game Shows As Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at Game Shows as Marketing. They've been around
                for almost 80 years and entertain millions, but game shows are also powerful marketing vehicles. We'll
                trace their history from early radio to their debut on network television and explore their interesting
                evolution from quiz shows (and quiz show scandals) to the modern game show format. We'll also analyze
                how Let's Make A Deal and The Price is Right work with advertisers to sell thousands of products. And
                we'll tell a fascinating tale of how one contestant broke down the basic advertising formula of The
                Price Is Right to win big.

            <title>S2E16 (Archive) - Loss Leaders: How Companies Profit By Losing Money</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we explore "Loss Leaders - the very interesting selling
                strategy where one product is given away for free, or at a high discount, in order to attract people to
                buy another more profitable product. We'll track the earliest loss leaders of shaving blades and Jell-O
                recipes, all the way up to today's printers, video games and even Kindles - all of which are loss
                leaders. You might be surprised to know how many loss leaders swirl all around you every day.
                Advertisers know what to give away in order to profit.
                This is an archived episode that aired originally on April 20, 2013.

            <title>S2E17 (Archive) - Brand Envy 2013</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it's my annual look at the brands I envy. They may not be
                the hippest, or the latest, or even the coolest brands. They could be a product, a service or even a
                person - but I envy them for a reason. Like a famous toy that was discovered when its inventor was
                installing a light fixture, a television network that leads the Emmy race every year, a knife that can
                be identified from 30 feet away and a person who has built an empire by breaking all the rules. All
                extraordinary brands, all I envy as a marketer.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, it's Tales of Customer Service. We're on the hunt for
                great companies that went out of their way to treat their customers well. From an amusement park that
                delivered such superior customer service that other corporations asked for lessons to a shoe company you
                can order a pizza from to a store that actually accepted a returned product they didn't even sell just
                to keep their customer happy - join us as we search for companies that go the extra inch.

            <title>S2E12 (Archive) - Selling Danger</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: In the history of the advertising industry, the full force of
                persuasion has been put behind many products that turned out to be incredibly unsafe. Even when those
                products were used exactly as advertised, they created enormous hazards, physical risk, and in some
                cases, even death. We'll explore how we invited asbestos and DDT into our homes as miracle products, how
                certain games for children ended up posing incredible risks, and how a much-heralded drug ended up being
                one of the most devastating products in modern history. In most of these cases, no one could foresee
                they were selling danger.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Along with the most famous marketing blunder of all time - the Edsel
                - we'll look at what caused Coke to make the mistake of changing their fabled formula, how a company
                actually went out of business by promising a product improvement, how a fashion house tweeted
                inappropriately and had an immediate PR disaster, and why a fast food company made a big mistake betting
                on the U.S. Olympic team. They're all great stories. Just be glad they didn't happen to you.

            <description>This week, we look at the use of brand names in songs. Sometimes lyrical mentions lead to major
                brand success. Other times, to lawsuits and bans. But the stories behind each are fascinating. And our
                list may even include some of your favourite songs.

                creative movie trailers. We'll see how Walt Disney convinced the public to watch the first-ever
                full-length animated movie, why some trailers don't show a frame of the actual film they're advertising,
                how some trailers contain footage not found in the movie itself and we'll tell the story of why
                thousands of people bought tickets to a movie, watched a trailer, then got up and went home.

            <title>S2E09 (Archive) - Marketing Stunts</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at Marketing Stunts. Many brands try to get into
                the Guinness Book of World Records as a marketing strategy. With that in mind, we'll talk about how an
                energy drink staged a record-breaking jump from space, why a giant popsicle stunt melted before it even
                started, how unsuspecting travellers ended up running through a train station like James Bond, and how
                Richard Branson pulled off a stunt that drove British Airways crazy. Hope you join us for some
                eyebrow-raising stories.

            <title>S8E05 - Monastic Merchandise: Products Made By Monks</title>
            <description>This week, we look at products made by monks. Monks create a myriad of merchandise that is sold
                to the public. Some sing and sell CDs of their chants. Others brew their own beer. A few even deal in
                cannabis. But in almost all cases, the products sell well and sell fast. And the reasons why are
                fascinating.

            <title>S2E01 (Archive) - Shame: The Secret Tool of Marketing</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Kicking off Season 2, we explore one of the most effective marketing
                strategies ever devised: The use of "Shame." First emerging in the late 1800s, toothpaste ads suggested
                a fresh mouth could help you attract a mate. But advertisers had a major obstacle to overcome - bad
                breath and body odour were not socially unacceptable then. So advertisers focused their sizable
                resources to linking odours to shame, and then shame to product solution. From bad breath, dandruff and
                ring-around-the-collar to gray hair, plastic surgery and skin lightening, the strategy of social shame
                has become the most lucrative selling strategy of all time. Join us as we peel back the layers of shame
                in our modern world.

            <title>S2E02 (Archive) - A Prize In Every Box: Box-Tops, Toys and Free Prizes</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: Remember when you were growing up, and you'd find a prize inside your
                cereal box? Prizes, premiums and box-top offers have been a staple of modern marketing since the 1800s.
                We'll tell the story of how the first ever box-top offer was the result of a critical marketing mistake
                - but it set the stage for a century of product giveaways. We'll also explore the psychology of free
                prizes, like how the public is instantly attracted to a mail-in offer, but so few go to the trouble of
                redeeming their prize.

            <title>S2E03 (Archive) - Timing Is Everything</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the critical importance of timing in marketing.
                It's one thing to put the right message in front of the right person, but it's a fine art to put it in
                front of them at the perfect moment. We'll look at how the United States Navy used perfect timing to
                double their applications by taking advantage of a certain movie playing in theatres. We'll explain why
                Dr. Scholl's chose to pitch insoles in the washrooms of nightclubs. And how Hellman's Mayonnaise used
                perfect timing to get to women in grocery stores. We'll also talk about how Target stores know you're
                pregnant before your family does, and we'll wrap up the episode by explaining why the fishing lure
                industry has Marilyn Monroe to thank. All true. All due to great timing.

                timing to double their applications by taking advantage of a certain movie playing in theatres. We'll
                explain why Dr. Scholl's chose to pitch insoles in the washrooms of nightclubs. And how Hellman's
                Mayonnaise used perfect timing to get to women in grocery stores. We'll also talk about how Target
                stores know you're pregnant before your family does, and we'll wrap up the episode by explaining why the
                fishing lure industry has Marilyn Monroe to thank. All true. All due to great timing.

            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the incredible creativity happening in radio
                advertising today. Many advertisers think radio is yesterday's medium, but judging by the incredible

                advertising ideas that have won in recent international award shows, including one remarkable idea that
                used code to reach kidnapped soldiers in Columbia.

            <title>S2E05 (Archive) - Buy Less: How Some Companies Profit By Asking You to Spend Less</title>
            <description>From the Digital Box Set: This week, we look at the companies that actually profit by asking
                you to BUY LESS. We'll explore a burger company that asks its customers to eat less beef, a printing
                company helps you print less, why Gillette has suddenly started encouraging men to change blades less
                often, and why a clothing company insists that you buy less of their apparel. It's a completely
                counter-intuitive marketing strategy, but each of these companies is doing more business than ever.
